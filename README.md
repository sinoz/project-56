# ReStart
A trading web-application for game accounts, as a university project developed with Play Framework.

## Setup
Pull and load the project into your IDE as a SBT project. This might take a while as SBT will pull all of its necessary dependencies for this application.

### IntelliJ IDEA
Once SBT has completed its work and IntelliJ has finished indexing, add a new default Play 2 App runtime configuration. You can now run the application. It will automatically open and load up the index page at http://localhost:9000.

### Alternative
You can also run this application using command line or terminal using SBT. Simply navigate to the application's root folder and hit:

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.
